<p>Funk The Pandemic was a local funk music festival hosted at Silver Park this summer.  The festival showcased local bands, DJs, Food Trucks, and artists all alike. <br />
The man behind it all was none other than the local legend, Mark Myriad.  Mark is a renowned local DJ with a big focus on community events and involvement.  Mark had <br />
reached out to me in hopes of doing an unconventional form of advertisement for his upcoming event, Funk The Pandemic.  He wanted me to do a graffiti style piece on  <br />
the California Street Bridge graffiti wall advertising his festival.  I had never done anything consigned by another person, or something this large but I was eager to take<br />
on the task and push my level of creativity further than I usually would.  The Funk The Pandemic piece stretched almost 50' long and took over 4.5 hours to complete.<br />
During this 4.5 hour timespan, it was 103 degrees and there was little to no shade nearby so I absolutely torched myself in the sun painting this.  Despite the treacherous <br />
heat and having to put up with all of the homeless and mentally insane people in the area I had an incredible time painting this for the first ever local funk music festival. <br />
I look forward to more experimentation with extremely large pieces as well as potentially working with Mark again for whatever he has going on. <br />
